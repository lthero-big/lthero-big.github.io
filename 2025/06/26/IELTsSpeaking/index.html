<blockquote>
<p>Describe an invention that has changed the world in a positive way</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You should say:</p>
<p>•        <strong>what</strong> it is</p>
<p>•        Basically, AI brings many benefits</p>
<p>•        <strong>how</strong> it influences people of different ages</p>
<p>•        <strong>explain</strong> how it changed people’s lives = how you felt about it</p>
<h3 id="大纲">大纲</h3>
<p>•        <strong>what</strong> it is</p>
<p>•        AI is a new invention that was just released several years ago</p>
<p>•        For example, there are many AI applications like DeepSeek and ChatGPT</p>
<p>•        Personally, I use it everyday</p>
<p>•        <strong>what</strong> benefits it has brought</p>
<p>•        Basically, AI brings many benefits</p>
<p>•        Firstly, it reduces the cost of generating content</p>
<p>•        Secondly, it can improve our efficiency at work</p>
<p>•        <strong>how</strong> it influences people of different ages</p>
<p>•        Overall, all kinds of people can be benefited by AI</p>
<p>•        For the kids, AI help them calculate the math equations and correct their errors</p>
<p>•        For the elderly, it allows them to seek for useful information they need</p>
<p>•        <strong>explain</strong> how it changed people’s lives = how you felt about it</p>
<p>AI is a new invention that was just released several years ago which changed the world significantly. For example, there are many AI applications like DeepSeek and ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Firstly, it significantly reduces the cost and effort required to generate content. It allows creators to get video clips or images by simplely typing a descriptive prompt. Plus, AI dramatically improves our efficiency at work. For instance, it can help draft documents and summarize long reports , which save up people’s valuable time for other tasks.</p>
<p>Secondly, AI influences people across all age groups. For children, AI can serve as an interactive learning companion, helping them solve complex math equations and offering instant feedback to correct their mistakes. For elderly floks, they can seek useful information and manage daily tasks simply by asking questions in a natural way on their AI-powered smartphones.</p>
<p>Initially, I was doubted whether AI was as powful as people said. However, after trying it for the first time, I was completely amazed by its power. Now, I try to make good use of AI as a powerful assistant in my daily life. Meanwhile, I am trying not relying heavily on it, focusing on strengthening abilities of problem-solving by myself.</p>
<h2 id="part-3">Part 3</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the most helpful innovation at work?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my view, two types of innovation are helpful at work.</p>
<p>The first is AI assistants, such as ChatGPT. They are useful for quickly drafting documents, summarizing long reports, or even giving creative ideas, which significantly imporve our efficiency at work.</p>
<p>The second is collaborative online platforms like FeiShu and Google Workspace. These tools allow teams to work on documents simultaneously and share information instantly, greatly improving teamwork and efficiency/flexibility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What household appliances make us lazy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several modern household appliances, while convenient, could be seen as contributing to a more sedentary lifestyle. Two prominent examples come to mind.</p>
<p>First, the robotic vacuum cleaner diligently cleans our floors on its own schedule. This automation completely removes the need for the physical work of walking with a traditional vacuum around the house.</p>
<p>Second, the dishwasher takes over the daily chore of washing dishes. By simply loading the machine and pressing a button, saving our time to do other things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What kinds of inventions can be used at school?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Certainly, several modern inventions can significantly enhance the school learning environment, with two standing out.</p>
<p>First, interactive smart whiteboards are a key innovation. They replace traditional blackboards and connect directly to a computer, allowing teachers to write, draw, and project relevant digital content for a more dynamic lesson.</p>
<p>Another simple yet crucial invention is a classroom speaker. This device amplifies the teacher’s voice so that every student can hear clearly, which is especially helpful for teachers with softer voices.</p>
<p>Overall, these tools help create a more engaging and accessible educational setting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you think AI will replace human teachers? Why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe AI is unlikely to completely replace human teachers; instead, it will handle simple tasks while complex and safety-related roles will still require a human touch.</p>
<p>On one hand, AI can take over repetitive and tedious jobs. For instance, it can provide students with personalized practice exercises and then automatically grade their scores, saving teachers’ time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a human teacher is essential for tasks requiring emotional intelligence and judgment. They can inspire creativity, and manage classroom to ensure a good learning environment, which are deeply human skills.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, I could send my context and a clear prompt to it</li>
<li>Second, after a while, it will return an answer to me</li>
<li>Maybe, I wouldn’t be satisfied by it at first</li>
<li>So, I would finetune/optimize my prompt so that AI can return me a better version of it</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>Describe a website that sells second-hand items</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>what it is</li>
<li>how you found out about it</li>
<li>what people can buy from it</li>
<li>explain whether you like it</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to share with you a website called xianyu ,which is kind of like the Chinese version of eBay, where people trade different products and services.</p>
<p>It’s a quite popular application in China especially among the young people, I first heard about it from my friend, who’s always hunting for cool second-hand stuffs on it. Then, I got curious and started browsing myself.</p>
<p>On Xianyu, people can find literally everything, from gift cards, books and clothes to digital products like smartphone, laptop , camera and even some online services, for example, I met my English tutor on it.</p>
<p>Personally, I once used that app to buy a second-hand ipad after receiving my scholarship. The price was great, and it looked almost new in the pictures. When it arrived, the screen had some lines across it—like it had been dropped before. I messaged the seller, but he said it must’ve happened during shipping. Obviously classic excuse. In the end, I got a partial refund. Since then, I’ve become way more careful when shopping second-items online, this app reduces the threshold for people to become a seller, so we should always asking for extra pictures and checking more reviews before deciding which one to buy.</p>
<h2 id="part3">Part3</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people think it’s a waste to buy too many clothes for children. What do you think?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do think it’s a waste to buy too many clothes for children.</p>
<p>Firstly, children nowadays just grow too quickly. As a result, they have to purchase more and more clothes, which could be a waste of money and resource.</p>
<p>Secondly, people can recycle clothes that they don’t want anymore, or to donate to those who need them the most.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what do you usually do with a cell phone?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My phone is basically my second brain, I can do literally everything on it. It provide so many useful functions for me to text with friends, scroll videos, order food. And  you might not believe it, there are almost like five delivery apps on my phone, so I can just choose any app depend on my mood on that day.</p>
<p>Personally, as you know, as a student, I rely heavily on the AI capabilities of my phone to support my studies. These AI-powered functions are a huge helper, assisting me with everything from research and writing to organizing my study schedule and preparing for exams.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are the differences between young people and old people when using a cell phone?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are huge differences in the usage between. old and young people.</p>
<p>For young people. they mostly use cell phone for self improvement. Many white collar workers actually spend a lot of time and energy on their phone listening to some podcasts, yeah, or even online courses.</p>
<p>However, the old people would just entertain with a cell phone. since they have nothing to do, they would spend much time on their phone scrolling videos. Or just reading some latest news</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what can be done to stop cell phone addiction</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many ways that we can do. to stop us addicted to the cell phone</p>
<p>the first is that we can。Do more physical exercise. ok like going to the gym  like going to the gym。Or the park so that we are away from the cell phone</p>
<p>the second method is that we can download the。The specialized apps designed Help Design to help us concentrate on what matters the most. For example, people could set their screen time so that they can limit their exposure to the phone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you think it is too late to call others at eleven or twelve o’clock at night?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, it really depends on different situations. It depends on who you are calling.</p>
<p>for young people, I think calling them so late is fine. Because as you know, they just they usually stay up late or simply go to bed quite late. Yeah, because most of them would be more energetic, especially in the evening.</p>
<p>However. if we are talking about elderly folks then it might not be a rational choice. as you know most old people are used to going to bed quite early. Probably. because they have more priorities things uh they have more prioritized the things to do the next morning</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you think there should be a law to stop people from making phone calls in public?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the common sense the laws should only people should only abide by the law.</p>
<p>The normally the laws will only take care of severe behaviors. While answering phone on public should be considered as a basic human right, and the law shouldn’t be so strict otherwise the law loses its <strong>seriousness</strong> and becomes difficult to enforce.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What problems will occur if people don’t recycle?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If fewer people choose to recycle it will lead to lots of problems <strong>,</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, people would simply waste a lot of their own money. For me, the things that I don’t want anymore can be sold on second hand websites. it could partially saves money.</p>
<p>another consequence is that the environment could get worse if the products that they don’t want anymore are disposed instead of recycled. The air quality and water quality will be contaminated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Should the government encourage people to recycle items?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it totally makes sense for the government to encourage people to recycle</p>
<p>first, for the residents. They can save money by selling their items on second hand websites to those who need them the most, by doing this they partially saved money instead of just directly disposing them.</p>
<p>Another reason is that recycling can also play a very important role in protection of the environment, if not executed well, The air quality and water quality could be contaminated.</p>
<h2 id="part2">Part2</h2>
<p>Describe a cultural place that you would like to learn the culture there(e.g. a libraay, museum, theater)</p>
<p>Where it is,</p>
<p>How you knew about this place?</p>
<p>What it is like?</p>
<p>explain how this place is related to culture(How you feel)</p>
<p>I would like to share you with the Former Residence of Qu Yuan which is a significant cultural site in China.</p>
<p>The residence is located in Hubei province, in the central part of China, and is quite accessible, typically taking less than an hour to reach by metro or bus.</p>
<p>My first encounter with Qu Yuan was in my primary school classes. As I gained further interest on it, I began to research him and his stories online trying to dig out more details behind it.</p>
<p>The residence is a magnificent sight. From a distance, its architecture is immediately impressive. As you walk closer, you can find out there are two floors. Once you step through the main gate, you’ll be amazed by all the collection of artifacts. The ground floor serves as an exhibition hall, showcasing the life and legacy of Qu Yuan—his famous poems, his political contributions.</p>
<p>At first, because I had never been there, I was a bit doubtful and couldn’t fully understand why so many people admired this place. However, as I learned more, I became deeply convinced and moved by the powerful stories behind the man himself. The residence is more than just a building; it’s represent a pivotal figure in our history, and that deep connection to our cultural roots is what makes it so compelling(attractive).</p>
<h2 id="part3">Part3</h2>
<p><strong>So what kind of culture is popular among young people?</strong></p>
<p>I believe there are many different kinds of cultures popular among young people right now.</p>
<p>First, I would say that staying up late has become a significant part of youth culture. Many young people claim to be more efficient and energetic at midnight, embracing a nocturnal lifestyle.</p>
<p>A second prevalent cultural trend is cell phone addiction. It’s common to see young people spending an excessive amount of time on their screens like scrolling videos. Their phones literally capture all of their attention, making them easily distracted from what truly matters.</p>
<p><strong>So how do young people learn about different cultures?</strong></p>
<p>Young people today have numerous sources for learning about different cultures.</p>
<p>The most conventional way is through online channels, particularly social media platforms like YouTube. A huge number of content creators produce all these interesting videos that showcase diverse cultures from all over the world, making this a very accessible way to learn.</p>
<p>However, a second, and I would say more effective, method is through direct, in-person experience. This involves traveling and interacting with locals firsthand. By speaking directly with people and observing their way of life, people can learn the practical ‘know-how’—the knowledge and customs that cannot be fully captured or codified in online content.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>So how is a culture formed?</strong></p>

<p>描述一部最近看的剧，下面以Shameless举例</p>
<p>I’d like to share a TV series with you named <em>Shameless</em>. It’s a remarkable show that has both a UK and a US version. The British one came out a bit earlier in 2004, but I watched the American adaptation which started in 2011.</p>
<p>The series revolves around the daily life of the Gallagher family, who live in the South Side of Chicago. It tells the story of an alcoholic and narcissistic father, Frank, and his six intelligent and independent children. The eldest, Fiona, who is only in her early twenties, has to take on the parental role to raise her five younger siblings.</p>
<p>I first came across this show back in 2022 when I saw some short clips of it on social media. The chaotic yet heartwarming family dynamic immediately caught my attention. As I gained further interest in this series, I searched for it online to know more details. Eventually, I started watching it on Netflix and got through nine seasons. I still haven’t watched the final two seasons because I just don’t want this incredible story to end.</p>
<p>Honestly, when I first saw the show’s title and poster, it didn’t appeal to me at all. I thought it would be just another generic drama. However, once I started the first episode, I was completely hooked and ended up binge-watching several episodes in one go. I even enthusiastically recommended it to my friends. Although they didn’t seem to share the same level of interest, I still enjoyed the process. For me, <em>Shameless</em> is definitely one of the best TV series I’ve ever seen, right up there with <em>Breaking Bad</em>, and I always hope to meet other people who love it as much as I do.</p>

<h3 id="问题一">问题一</h3>
<p>Describe your favorite food at a traditional festival or a special event in your country</p>
<ul>
<li>What it is</li>
<li>At which festival/event you eat it</li>
<li>how it is made</li>
<li>explain why you like it</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to share with you a traditional Chinese food that many people like to eat, especially during traditional festivals. It is a dish that almost every Chinese person has been eating for years, and it has already symbolized the traditional culture of china.</p>
<p>We usually eat Jiaozi during important festivals, like the Spring Festival or anytime we get together with our family members. During these times, we would also usually go to pray at temples. For example, If it’s the Mid-Autumn Festival we would also enjoy mooncakes at the same time.</p>
<p>Well when we talk about how they are made, the process itself is a very simple. The first step to make Jiaozi is to prepare all the raw ingredients/materials, like meat, or vegetables if you are a vegetarian, and of course, the dough, which is made of flour. Second, you need to wrap the fillings in the dough in a specific way. Third, the wrapped Jiaozi should be cooked in boiling water for about 20 to 30 minutes.</p>
<p>At first, I was pretty doubtful why everybody liked it so much because to me, it just seemed like a random food. After I tried it and gained more interested in it, I realized that the time we spend with our family and those we love is the most important thing. So in the future I’m sure that I’ll be grateful for such a food, and I will also treasure of time eating jiaozi.</p>
<h3 id="问题二">问题二</h3>
<p>Describe a popular/well-known person in your country</p>
<ul>
<li>Who this person is.</li>
<li>What he/she has done</li>
<li>why he/she is popular</li>
<li>explain how you feel about this person</li>
</ul>
<p>I would like to share with you Qu Yuan who was a significant historical figure and probably one of the most popular poets in China. He served as a high-ranking official in one of China’s ancient dynasties. Furthermore, he was a very famous poet who wrote many beautiful and influential poems which was already documented in his former residence.</p>
<p>As an official, he contributed a lot to his country. He provided his king with many useful suggestions and strategies such as forming alliances with other countries to resis the threat of the country Qin. Unfortunately, his suggestions was dismissed by the king, and he was exiled. Later, when Qu Yuan heard that capital of his country had been captured by the enemy, he was so sad and hopeless that he jumped into the River as a form of protest.</p>
<p>Well, I think there are several reasons that make him popular. He is still so popular today not just because of his amazing poems, but because he is a symbol of patriotism and integrity. People respect him because he wasn’t afraid of powerful people and always stuck to his beliefs, no matter what.</p>
<p>At first, I was pretty doubtful why everybody liked him so much because to me, he just seemed like a ordinary guy. After I gained further interests in him, I even searched online for more deails, Then I realized I was convinced by his courage of sticking to his own opinion and his incredible talent as well.</p>
<h2 id="part3">part3</h2>
<p><strong>问题：What kinds of people are popular at work?</strong></p>
<p>回复：there are many factors that make someone popular at work.</p>
<p>First, kind people are usually very popular. I think it’s their kindness that really makes a difference. As you know, a kind person in the workplace is always willing to help you whenever you have a problem. They will offer a helping hand to anyone who is in need.</p>
<p>Well, moreover, people who are smart are definitely popular and admired by their colleagues. This is because everyone wants to work with a smart person, as they can often provide unique solutions and solve problems in a creative way. And that’s really valuable because, at work, there are always tons of difficulties and problems that need creative thinking to be solved.</p>
<p><strong>问题：Which one is more important, maintaining a good relationship with colleagues or doing well at work?</strong></p>
<p>回复：Well, I believe both of these are very important. In my opinion, they are equally important for a successful career.</p>
<p>On one hand, getting along well with your colleagues is a big advantage. It can help you go further in your career because you can always depend on each other for support, especially when you run into difficulties at work.</p>
<p>On the other hand, performing well at your job is also crucial. When you consistently do good work, you earn the  respect of your colleagues and your boss. People will trust your skills and want to include you in important projects, which naturally leads to better opportunities and promotions.</p>
<p><strong>问题：What benefits are there when a child is popular at school?</strong></p>
<p>I believe there are many benefits when a child is popular at school.</p>
<p>First, popular kids are often admired by other children. Because of this, he or she will probably have more opportunities to make new friends, which is great for their social development.</p>
<p>Another benefit is that these popular children might also attract more attention from their teachers. Teachers sometimes tend to focus more on these students, and this extra attention could be good for their grades and their overall self-improvement.</p>
<p><strong>问题：Do do you think popular children will grow up to be popular adults?</strong></p>
<p>Well, I think popular children have a better chance of becoming popular adults, but it’s not guaranteed. I think there are a couple of reasons for this.</p>
<p>On one hand, being a popular child gives you some advantages. For example, they are used to getting more attention from others, which can help them shape their personality and build their confidence. This is obviously a good foundation for their future.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it also really depends on how they handle their relationships as they grow up. If they fail to maintain these relationships well, they probably won’t continue to be a popular adult.</p>
<p>To be honest, I think this happens a lot. As you know, the world of adults is just much more complicated.</p>
<p><strong>问题：Are bosses more popular than employees at work?</strong></p>
<p>Well, I would say employees are probably more popular than bosses at work, and I think there are a couple of reasons for this.</p>
<p>First, let’s think about the boss’s role. Bosses are the ones who give us orders, and sometimes they can be very demanding or set strict deadlines. This can create a lot of pressure, which naturally makes it difficult for employees to build a casual and friendly relationship with them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, employees usually have a lot in common with each other. We share similar roles and backgrounds within the company. Because we have these shared experiences and common goals—like finishing a project together—it’s much easier for us to connect, become friends, and build solid relationships.</p>
<p><strong>问题：Are there any disadvantages Ifa Child is popular at school?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I believe there can be several drawbacks for a child who is popular at school.</p>
<p>First, being popular can sometimes attract the wrong kind of attention from peers. For example, other kids might become envious or jealous of them. If that situation gets worse, this jealousy could lead to serious arguments or even cause the popular child to be isolated by others and there could be some severe quarrels or fights between them.</p>
<p>Another drawback is that popularity itself can be a big distraction. Popular children often need to spend a lot of time and energy maintaining all of their friendships. As a result, they can get distracted and might not have enough time to focus on their studies. In the long term, this could cause their grades to suffer.</p>
<p><strong>问题：Which is more important in terms of culture, literature or music.</strong></p>
<p>Well, in my opinion, I believe music is more crucial to a culture than literature, and I have a couple of reasons for this.</p>
<p>First, music is like a universal language. It doesn’t depend on literacy, so people don’t need to be able to read to understand it. People from all over the world can feel the rhythm and vibe in a piece of music, even if they don’t understand the lyrics. (Literature, on the other hand, is usually limited to people who speak and read a specific language.)</p>
<p>Second, I think music is more influential and can spread more widely in today’s world. It can easily be shared online and can combine traditional and modern styles. Because it’s so adaptable, I believe music often has a more profound and immediate impact on a wider audience than a book does.</p>
