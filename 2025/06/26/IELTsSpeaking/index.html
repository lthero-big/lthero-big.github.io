<blockquote>
<p>Describe an invention that has changed the world in a positive way</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You should say:</p>
<p>•        <strong>what</strong> it is</p>
<p>•        Basically, AI brings many benefits</p>
<p>•        <strong>how</strong> it influences people of different ages</p>
<p>•        <strong>explain</strong> how it changed people’s lives = how you felt about it</p>
<h3 id="大纲">大纲</h3>
<p>•        <strong>what</strong> it is</p>
<p>•        AI is a new invention that was just released several years ago</p>
<p>•        For example, there are many AI applications like DeepSeek and ChatGPT</p>
<p>•        Personally, I use it everyday</p>
<p>•        <strong>what</strong> benefits it has brought</p>
<p>•        Basically, AI brings many benefits</p>
<p>•        Firstly, it reduces the cost of generating content</p>
<p>•        Secondly, it can improve our efficiency at work</p>
<p>•        <strong>how</strong> it influences people of different ages</p>
<p>•        Overall, all kinds of people can be benefited by AI</p>
<p>•        For the kids, AI help them calculate the math equations and correct their errors</p>
<p>•        For the elderly, it allows them to seek for useful information they need</p>
<p>•        <strong>explain</strong> how it changed people’s lives = how you felt about it</p>
<p>AI is a new invention that was just released several years ago which changed the world significantly. For example, there are many AI applications like DeepSeek and ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Firstly, it significantly reduces the cost and effort required to generate content. It allows creators to get video clips or images by simplely typing a descriptive prompt. Plus, AI dramatically improves our efficiency at work. For instance, it can help draft documents and summarize long reports , which save up people’s valuable time for other tasks.</p>
<p>Secondly, AI influences people across all age groups. For children, AI can serve as an interactive learning companion, helping them solve complex math equations and offering instant feedback to correct their mistakes. For elderly floks, they can seek useful information and manage daily tasks simply by asking questions in a natural way on their AI-powered smartphones.</p>
<p>Initially, I was doubted whether AI was as powful as people said. However, after trying it for the first time, I was completely amazed by its power. Now, I try to make good use of AI as a powerful assistant in my daily life. Meanwhile, I am trying not relying heavily on it, focusing on strengthening abilities of problem-solving by myself.</p>
<h2 id="part-3">Part 3</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the most helpful innovation at work?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my view, two types of innovation are helpful at work.</p>
<p>The first is AI assistants, such as ChatGPT. They are useful for quickly drafting documents, summarizing long reports, or even giving creative ideas, which significantly imporve our efficiency at work.</p>
<p>The second is collaborative online platforms like FeiShu and Google Workspace. These tools allow teams to work on documents simultaneously and share information instantly, greatly improving teamwork and efficiency/flexibility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What household appliances make us lazy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several modern household appliances, while convenient, could be seen as contributing to a more sedentary lifestyle. Two prominent examples come to mind.</p>
<p>First, the robotic vacuum cleaner diligently cleans our floors on its own schedule. This automation completely removes the need for the physical work of walking with a traditional vacuum around the house.</p>
<p>Second, the dishwasher takes over the daily chore of washing dishes. By simply loading the machine and pressing a button, saving our time to do other things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What kinds of inventions can be used at school?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Certainly, several modern inventions can significantly enhance the school learning environment, with two standing out.</p>
<p>First, interactive smart whiteboards are a key innovation. They replace traditional blackboards and connect directly to a computer, allowing teachers to write, draw, and project relevant digital content for a more dynamic lesson.</p>
<p>Another simple yet crucial invention is a classroom speaker. This device amplifies the teacher’s voice so that every student can hear clearly, which is especially helpful for teachers with softer voices.</p>
<p>Overall, these tools help create a more engaging and accessible educational setting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you think AI will replace human teachers? Why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe AI is unlikely to completely replace human teachers; instead, it will handle simple tasks while complex and safety-related roles will still require a human touch.</p>
<p>On one hand, AI can take over repetitive and tedious jobs. For instance, it can provide students with personalized practice exercises and then automatically grade their scores, saving teachers’ time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a human teacher is essential for tasks requiring emotional intelligence and judgment. They can inspire creativity, and manage classroom to ensure a good learning environment, which are deeply human skills.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, I could send my context and a clear prompt to it</li>
<li>Second, after a while, it will return an answer to me</li>
<li>Maybe, I wouldn’t be satisfied by it at first</li>
<li>So, I would finetune/optimize my prompt so that AI can return me a better version of it</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>Describe a website that sells second-hand items</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>what it is</li>
<li>how you found out about it</li>
<li>what people can buy from it</li>
<li>explain whether you like it</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to share with you a website called xianyu ,which is kind of like the Chinese version of eBay, where people trade different products and services.</p>
<p>It’s a quite popular application in China especially among the young people, I first heard about it from my friend, who’s always hunting for cool second-hand stuffs on it. Then, I got curious and started browsing myself.</p>
<p>On Xianyu, people can find literally everything, from gift cards, books and clothes to digital products like smartphone, laptop , camera and even some online services, for example, I met my English tutor on it.</p>
<p>Personally, I once used that app to buy a second-hand ipad after receiving my scholarship. The price was great, and it looked almost new in the pictures. When it arrived, the screen had some lines across it—like it had been dropped before. I messaged the seller, but he said it must’ve happened during shipping. Obviously classic excuse. In the end, I got a partial refund. Since then, I’ve become way more careful when shopping second-items online, this app reduces the threshold for people to become a seller, so we should always asking for extra pictures and checking more reviews before deciding which one to buy.</p>
<h2 id="part3">Part3</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people think it’s a waste to buy too many clothes for children. What do you think?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do think it’s a waste to buy too many clothes for children.</p>
<p>Firstly, children nowadays just grow too quickly. As a result, they have to purchase more and more clothes, which could be a waste of money and resource.</p>
<p>Secondly, people can recycle clothes that they don’t want anymore, or to donate to those who need them the most.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what do you usually do with a cell phone?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My phone is basically my second brain, I can do literally everything on it. It provide so many useful functions for me to text with friends, scroll videos, order food. And  you might not believe it, there are almost like five delivery apps on my phone, so I can just choose any app depend on my mood on that day.</p>
<p>Personally, as you know, as a student, I rely heavily on the AI capabilities of my phone to support my studies. These AI-powered functions are a huge helper, assisting me with everything from research and writing to organizing my study schedule and preparing for exams.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are the differences between young people and old people when using a cell phone?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are huge differences in the usage between. old and young people.</p>
<p>For young people. they mostly use cell phone for self improvement. Many white collar workers actually spend a lot of time and energy on their phone listening to some podcasts, yeah, or even online courses.</p>
<p>However, the old people would just entertain with a cell phone. since they have nothing to do, they would spend much time on their phone scrolling videos. Or just reading some latest news</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what can be done to stop cell phone addiction</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many ways that we can do. to stop us addicted to the cell phone</p>
<p>the first is that we can。Do more physical exercise. ok like going to the gym  like going to the gym。Or the park so that we are away from the cell phone</p>
<p>the second method is that we can download the。The specialized apps designed Help Design to help us concentrate on what matters the most. For example, people could set their screen time so that they can limit their exposure to the phone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you think it is too late to call others at eleven or twelve o’clock at night?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, it really depends on different situations. It depends on who you are calling.</p>
<p>for young people, I think calling them so late is fine. Because as you know, they just they usually stay up late or simply go to bed quite late. Yeah, because most of them would be more energetic, especially in the evening.</p>
<p>However. if we are talking about elderly folks then it might not be a rational choice. as you know most old people are used to going to bed quite early. Probably. because they have more priorities things uh they have more prioritized the things to do the next morning</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you think there should be a law to stop people from making phone calls in public?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the common sense the laws should only people should only abide by the law.</p>
<p>The normally the laws will only take care of severe behaviors. While answering phone on public should be considered as a basic human right, and the law shouldn’t be so strict otherwise the law loses its <strong>seriousness</strong> and becomes difficult to enforce.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What problems will occur if people don’t recycle?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If fewer people choose to recycle it will lead to lots of problems <strong>,</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, people would simply waste a lot of their own money. For me, the things that I don’t want anymore can be sold on second hand websites. it could partially saves money.</p>
<p>another consequence is that the environment could get worse if the products that they don’t want anymore are disposed instead of recycled. The air quality and water quality will be contaminated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Should the government encourage people to recycle items?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it totally makes sense for the government to encourage people to recycle</p>
<p>first, for the residents. They can save money by selling their items on second hand websites to those who need them the most, by doing this they partially saved money instead of just directly disposing them.</p>
<p>Another reason is that recycling can also play a very important role in protection of the environment, if not executed well, The air quality and water quality could be contaminated.</p>
<h2 id="part2">Part2</h2>
<p>Describe a cultural place that you would like to learn the culture there(e.g. a libraay, museum, theater)</p>
<p>Where it is,</p>
<p>How you knew about this place?</p>
<p>What it is like?</p>
<p>explain how this place is related to culture(How you feel)</p>
<p>I would like to share you with the Former Residence of Qu Yuan which is a significant cultural site in China.</p>
<p>The residence is located in Hubei province, in the central part of China, and is quite accessible, typically taking less than an hour to reach by metro or bus.</p>
<p>My first encounter with Qu Yuan was in my primary school classes. As I gained further interest on it, I began to research him and his stories online trying to dig out more details behind it.</p>
<p>The residence is a magnificent sight. From a distance, its architecture is immediately impressive. As you walk closer, you can find out there are two floors. Once you step through the main gate, you’ll be amazed by all the collection of artifacts. The ground floor serves as an exhibition hall, showcasing the life and legacy of Qu Yuan—his famous poems, his political contributions.</p>
<p>At first, because I had never been there, I was a bit doubtful and couldn’t fully understand why so many people admired this place. However, as I learned more, I became deeply convinced and moved by the powerful stories behind the man himself. The residence is more than just a building; it’s represent a pivotal figure in our history, and that deep connection to our cultural roots is what makes it so compelling(attractive).</p>
<h2 id="part3">Part3</h2>
<p><strong>So what kind of culture is popular among young people?</strong></p>
<p>I believe there are many different kinds of cultures popular among young people right now.</p>
<p>First, I would say that staying up late has become a significant part of youth culture. Many young people claim to be more efficient and energetic at midnight, embracing a nocturnal lifestyle.</p>
<p>A second prevalent cultural trend is cell phone addiction. It’s common to see young people spending an excessive amount of time on their screens like scrolling videos. Their phones literally capture all of their attention, making them easily distracted from what truly matters.</p>
<p><strong>So how do young people learn about different cultures?</strong></p>
<p>Young people today have numerous sources for learning about different cultures.</p>
<p>The most conventional way is through online channels, particularly social media platforms like YouTube. A huge number of content creators produce all these interesting videos that showcase diverse cultures from all over the world, making this a very accessible way to learn.</p>
<p>However, a second, and I would say more effective, method is through direct, in-person experience. This involves traveling and interacting with locals firsthand. By speaking directly with people and observing their way of life, people can learn the practical ‘know-how’—the knowledge and customs that cannot be fully captured or codified in online content.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>So how is a culture formed?</strong></p>

<p>描述一部最近看的剧，下面以Shameless举例</p>
<p>I’d like to share a TV series with you named <em>Shameless</em>. It’s a remarkable show that has both a UK and a US version. The British one came out a bit earlier in 2004, but I watched the American adaptation which started in 2011.</p>
<p>The series revolves around the daily life of the Gallagher family, who live in the South Side of Chicago. It tells the story of an alcoholic and narcissistic father, Frank, and his six intelligent and independent children. The eldest, Fiona, who is only in her early twenties, has to take on the parental role to raise her five younger siblings.</p>
<p>I first came across this show back in 2022 when I saw some short clips of it on social media. The chaotic yet heartwarming family dynamic immediately caught my attention. As I gained further interest in this series, I searched for it online to know more details. Eventually, I started watching it on Netflix and got through nine seasons. I still haven’t watched the final two seasons because I just don’t want this incredible story to end.</p>
<p>Honestly, when I first saw the show’s title and poster, it didn’t appeal to me at all. I thought it would be just another generic drama. However, once I started the first episode, I was completely hooked and ended up binge-watching several episodes in one go. I even enthusiastically recommended it to my friends. Although they didn’t seem to share the same level of interest, I still enjoyed the process. For me, <em>Shameless</em> is definitely one of the best TV series I’ve ever seen, right up there with <em>Breaking Bad</em>, and I always hope to meet other people who love it as much as I do.</p>

<p>Describe your favorite food at a traditional festival or a special event in your country</p>
<ul>
<li>What it is</li>
<li>At which festival/event you eat it</li>
<li>how it is made</li>
<li>explain why you like it</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to share with you a traditional Chinese food that many people like to eat, especially during traditional festivals. It is a dish that almost every Chinese person has been eating for years, and it has already symbolized the traditional culture of china.</p>
<p>We usually eat Jiaozi during important festivals, like the Spring Festival or anytime we get together with our family members. During these times, we would also usually go to pray at temples. For example, If it’s the Mid-Autumn Festival we would also enjoy mooncakes at the same time.</p>
<p>Well when we talk about how they are made, the process itself is a very simple. The first step to make Jiaozi is to prepare all the raw ingredients/materials, like meat, or vegetables if you are a vegetarian, and of course, the dough, which is made of flour. Second, you need to wrap the fillings in the dough in a specific way. Third, the wrapped Jiaozi should be cooked in boiling water for about 20 to 30 minutes.</p>
<p>At first, I was pretty doubtful why everybody liked it so much because to me, it just seemed like a random food. After I tried it and gained more interested in it, I realized that the time we spend with our family and those we love is the most important thing. So in the future I’m sure that I’ll be grateful for such a food, and I will also treasure of time eating jiaozi.</p>

<p>Describe a popular/well-known person in your country</p>
<ul>
<li>Who this person is.</li>
<li>What he/she has done</li>
<li>why he/she is popular</li>
<li>explain how you feel about this person</li>
</ul>
<p>I would like to share with you Qu Yuan who was a significant historical figure and probably one of the most popular poets in China. He served as a high-ranking official in one of China’s ancient dynasties. Furthermore, he was a very famous poet who wrote many beautiful and influential poems which was already documented in his former residence.</p>
<p>As an official, he contributed a lot to his country. He provided his king with many useful suggestions and strategies such as forming alliances with other countries to resis the threat of the country Qin. Unfortunately, his suggestions was dismissed by the king, and he was exiled. Later, when Qu Yuan heard that capital of his country had been captured by the enemy, he was so sad and hopeless that he jumped into the River as a form of protest.</p>
<p>Well, I think there are several reasons that make him popular. He is still so popular today not just because of his amazing poems, but because he is a symbol of patriotism and integrity. People respect him because he wasn’t afraid of powerful people and always stuck to his beliefs, no matter what.</p>
<p>At first, I was pretty doubtful why everybody liked him so much because to me, he just seemed like a ordinary guy. After I gained further interests in him, I even searched online for more deails, Then I realized I was convinced by his courage of sticking to his own opinion and his incredible talent as well.</p>

<p><strong>问题：What kinds of people are popular at work?</strong></p>
<p>回复：there are many factors that make someone popular at work.</p>
<p>First, kind people are usually very popular. I think it’s their kindness that really makes a difference. As you know, a kind person in the workplace is always willing to help you whenever you have a problem. They will offer a helping hand to anyone who is in need.</p>
<p>Well, moreover, people who are smart are definitely popular and admired by their colleagues. This is because everyone wants to work with a smart person, as they can often provide unique solutions and solve problems in a creative way. And that’s really valuable because, at work, there are always tons of difficulties and problems that need creative thinking to be solved.</p>
<p><strong>问题：Which one is more important, maintaining a good relationship with colleagues or doing well at work?</strong></p>
<p>回复：Well, I believe both of these are very important. In my opinion, they are equally important for a successful career.</p>
<p>On one hand, getting along well with your colleagues is a big advantage. It can help you go further in your career because you can always depend on each other for support, especially when you run into difficulties at work.</p>
<p>On the other hand, performing well at your job is also crucial. When you consistently do good work, you earn the  respect of your colleagues and your boss. People will trust your skills and want to include you in important projects, which naturally leads to better opportunities and promotions.</p>
<p><strong>问题：What benefits are there when a child is popular at school?</strong></p>
<p>I believe there are many benefits when a child is popular at school.</p>
<p>First, popular kids are often admired by other children. Because of this, he or she will probably have more opportunities to make new friends, which is great for their social development.</p>
<p>Another benefit is that these popular children might also attract more attention from their teachers. Teachers sometimes tend to focus more on these students, and this extra attention could be good for their grades and their overall self-improvement.</p>
<p><strong>问题：Do do you think popular children will grow up to be popular adults?</strong></p>
<p>Well, I think popular children have a better chance of becoming popular adults, but it’s not guaranteed. I think there are a couple of reasons for this.</p>
<p>On one hand, being a popular child gives you some advantages. For example, they are used to getting more attention from others, which can help them shape their personality and build their confidence. This is obviously a good foundation for their future.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it also really depends on how they handle their relationships as they grow up. If they fail to maintain these relationships well, they probably won’t continue to be a popular adult.</p>
<p>To be honest, I think this happens a lot. As you know, the world of adults is just much more complicated.</p>
<p><strong>问题：Are bosses more popular than employees at work?</strong></p>
<p>Well, I would say employees are probably more popular than bosses at work, and I think there are a couple of reasons for this.</p>
<p>First, let’s think about the boss’s role. Bosses are the ones who give us orders, and sometimes they can be very demanding or set strict deadlines. This can create a lot of pressure, which naturally makes it difficult for employees to build a casual and friendly relationship with them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, employees usually have a lot in common with each other. We share similar roles and backgrounds within the company. Because we have these shared experiences and common goals—like finishing a project together—it’s much easier for us to connect, become friends, and build solid relationships.</p>
<p><strong>问题：Are there any disadvantages Ifa Child is popular at school?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I believe there can be several drawbacks for a child who is popular at school.</p>
<p>First, being popular can sometimes attract the wrong kind of attention from peers. For example, other kids might become envious or jealous of them. If that situation gets worse, this jealousy could lead to serious arguments or even cause the popular child to be isolated by others and there could be some severe quarrels or fights between them.</p>
<p>Another drawback is that popularity itself can be a big distraction. Popular children often need to spend a lot of time and energy maintaining all of their friendships. As a result, they can get distracted and might not have enough time to focus on their studies. In the long term, this could cause their grades to suffer.</p>
<p><strong>问题：Which is more important in terms of culture, literature or music.</strong></p>
<p>Well, in my opinion, I believe music is more crucial to a culture than literature, and I have a couple of reasons for this.</p>
<p>First, music is like a universal language. It doesn’t depend on literacy, so people don’t need to be able to read to understand it. People from all over the world can feel the rhythm and vibe in a piece of music, even if they don’t understand the lyrics. (Literature, on the other hand, is usually limited to people who speak and read a specific language.)</p>
<p>Second, I think music is more influential and can spread more widely in today’s world. It can easily be shared online and can combine traditional and modern styles. Because it’s so adaptable, I believe music often has a more profound and immediate impact on a wider audience than a book does.</p>

<p>Describe an article on health you read in a magazine or on the internet</p>
<p>You should say:</p>
<p>•     <strong>what</strong> it was</p>
<p>•     <strong>where</strong> you read it</p>
<p>•     <strong>why</strong> you read it</p>
<p>•     how you felt about it</p>
<p>Well, I’d like to share with you an interesting health article I read online recently. The title was something along the lines of, “Be Happy, Live Longer.” If I had to conclude the whole article into one sentence, it would be that leading a happy life with a positive attitude is one of the keys to live longer.</p>
<p>I came across this article about two weeks ago on RedNote, which is a popular social media app in China, a bit like Instagram. I was actually chatting with a friend about some health-related topics, as I hadn’t been feeling that great lately. I was feeling a bit down due to some recent setbacks. Then he shared this article with me from the app, since I had nothing else to do and it came at the perfect time for me, I immediately started to read it.</p>
<p>Honestly, I can’t recall the specific name of the author, but I’m pretty sure they are an expert in this field. The article explained how a positive attitude can reduce stress and lower the risk of mental illness, which directly impacts our physical health.</p>
<p>At first, I was a bit doubtful, thinking it was just another ordinary article. But as I read it thoroughly, I was completely convinced by its philosophy.Reading that article made me realize that health isn’t just about eating vegetables or hitting the gym, it’s also about your attitude, taking care of my happiness is just as important as diet and exercise for my overall health.</p>

<p>Describe a person you know who has chosen a career in the medical field (e.g. a doctor, a nurse)</p>
<p>You should say:</p>
<p>•     <strong>who</strong> he/she is</p>
<p>•     <strong>what</strong> he/she does</p>
<p>•     <strong>why</strong> he/she chose this career</p>
<p>•     explain <strong>how you feel</strong> about him/her</p>
<p>I’d like to talk about a doctor I really respect, Zhong Nanshan. He’s a very famous doctor in China, and what’s amazing about him is that even though he’s over 80 years old, he’s always on the front line, fighting against new diseases.</p>
<p>He’s most famous for his work during the COVID-19 outbreak. When it started, he led a team of experts to fight the virus. He was on TV a lot, giving people important advice and telling everyone to stay calm. At the same time, he was also busy leading the research for a cure. Basically, everyone saw him as a person they could trust during that difficult time.</p>
<p>As for why he chose this career, I don’t think it was for fame or money. I watched an interview with him once, and he said he just really wants to save people’s lives and protect them from getting sick. I believe he has a real passion for helping others, and that seems to be his main motivation.</p>
<p>Honestly, my feelings about him have changed a lot. Before the pandemic, I knew his name, but he was just another famous doctor to me. But after seeing how hard he worked during that difficult time and how much contribution that he made to the country, I really started to admire him. I feel very lucky that we have a role model like him, and he’s a real inspiration.</p>

<p>•     who you do it with</p>
<p>•     explain why it can help you keep fit and healthy = how you felt about it</p>
<p>I’d like to talk about what I do to keep fit, which is basically going to the gym and running. My routine is usually a mix of aerobic exercise, like jogging on the treadmill, and some anaerobic exercise, like weight training. It’s a pretty popular way to stay in shape among young people nowadays.</p>
<p>I try to do this several times a week, often with my friends. Just last night, my best friend and I went to the gym together. We felt we had eaten some unhealthy food the day before, so we thought it was a good idea to burn some calories. It’s always more motivating to have a partner because we can encourage each other to keep going.</p>
<p>Honestly, when I first started, I was a bit doubtful about whether this routine would really help me. I guess I had never stuck to an exercise plan for a long time before, so I hadn’t seen any real benefits. But after I followed this plan for a couple of months, I really started to feel the difference. My health definitely improved. I felt more energetic during the day and even my mood got better. That’s when I was totally convinced, and it made me realize that consistency is the key to staying healthy and fit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you had any achievements recently？</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, I wouldn’t say I’ve had any major achievements recently, but there is something small that I’m quite proud of, which is related to my personal learning.</p>
<p>Over the past few weeks, I’ve been spending my time learning some new knowledge about machine learning. I watched online courses and readed articles to understand some of the key concepts. The main reason I consider this an achievement is that I was actually able to use this new knowledge to solve a real problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So have you ever been praised or encouraged by a teacher?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, definitely. I was lucky to have been encouraged by my teachers many times, especially during my high school years.</p>
<p>I remember this happening most often whenever I made small achievements or showed improvement in my studies. For example, if I got a better score on a difficult test or shared a creative idea in class, my teacher would notice. He wouldn’t just say “good job”; he would often encourage me to keep pushing myself and to always try to “go the extra mile.”</p>
<p>That kind of encouragement was incredibly important and motivating for me. He often told me that every small effort <strong>accumulates</strong>, and that all these little steps would eventually lead to future success. Hearing that really taught me that progress isn’t just about big wins, but about being consistent. That lesson has stayed with me for a long time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When was the last time you praised someone?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, it just happened last night. I had a chance to encourage my good friend, Tommy, who was feeling a bit down about his job.</p>
<p>He was quite worried about his future career path and was feeling a lot of pressure from a new project. He started to doubt his own ability to handle the challenge. The first thing I did was just to calm him down. I told him that I have complete faith in him and that this sort of thing was something he could handle perfectly.</p>
<p>After that, I tried to motivate him a bit more. I reminded him of his past successes and encouraged him to believe in himself. I told him not just to meet expectations, but to “go the extra mile” on this project to show everyone what he’s capable of. He seemed much more confident after our chat, so I was glad I could be there for him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do you feel when you are praised?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly, being praised always makes me feel really good, but for me, it’s more than just a happy feeling; it’s about feeling valued.</p>
<p>When someone praises me, I feel that my hard work has been seen and <strong>acknowledged</strong>. It’s a sign that they believe in me and trust my abilities. Sometimes, another person might notice a small achievement that I have overlooked myself, and that makes their praise feel even more meaningful and special.</p>
<p>More importantly, praise is a huge source of <strong>motivation</strong> for me. That feeling of being valued and trusted really encourages me to keep pushing myself and to “go the extra mile.” It gives me the confidence to take on new challenges and reminds me that my efforts are worthwhile, which is incredibly powerful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you think parents should always praise and encourage their children?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, I think it’s incredibly important for parents to praise and encourage their children, especially when they are young, although it needs to be done thoughtfully.</p>
<p>The main reason is that children need this kind of positive feedback to build up their <strong>self-confidence</strong>. For a child, praise from a parent works as a powerful form of <strong>external stimulus</strong> or motivation. When parents <strong>acknowledge</strong> their child’s efforts, it helps the child feel valued and capable, which is essential for their healthy emotional development.</p>
<p>However, I believe the ultimate goal of this praise is to help children gradually develop their own internal <strong>self-motivation</strong>. As they grow more confident from this encouragement, they learn to be proud of their own achievements without always needing approval from others. So, in the beginning, it’s a crucial tool to help them become independent and resilient adults.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>do you think doctors and nurses are very important?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, absolutely. I believe that both doctors and nurses are incredibly important to our society, and they each play a different but equally crucial role.</p>
<p>On one hand, for doctors, Their main job is to use their expert knowledge to <strong>diagnose</strong> our health problems and find ways to <strong>cure</strong> our illnesses. They are like medical detectives who figure out what’s wrong. Furthermore, they are also on the front line of <strong>research</strong>, working hard to find cures for new and dangerous diseases, like we saw during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>On the other hand, nurses are just as essential because they provide the direct, hands-on care that helps us recover. They give us practical advice on <strong>health-related issues</strong> and, more importantly, they offer emotional support. They help us build the confidence we need to defeat an illness, and that kind of encouragement can have a direct, positive <strong>impact</strong> on a patient’s physical recovery.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[总起句练习]Do you think doctors and nurses are very important?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Main Opening Sentences:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Yes, absolutely. In my view, both doctors and nurses are vital to our society, though they contribute in different ways.</li>
<li>When it comes to their importance, I believe it’s clear that doctors and nurses are both essential, each playing a unique and crucial role.</li>
<li>There’s no doubt in my mind that they are both incredibly important; our healthcare system simply couldn’t function without them.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>First Point (About Doctors):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>On one hand,</strong> doctors are responsible for the scientific and diagnostic side of medicine.</li>
<li><strong>Looking at the role of doctors,</strong> their main job is to use expert knowledge to diagnose illnesses and research new cures.</li>
<li><strong>The primary contribution of doctors</strong> is to act as medical detectives, figuring out what’s wrong with a patient.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Second Point (About Nurses):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>On the other hand,</strong> nurses are just as essential for providing direct, hands-on patient care.</li>
<li><strong>The role of nurses, in contrast,</strong> focuses on the recovery and support phase of treatment.</li>
<li><strong>Equally important is the compassionate,</strong> hands-on care that nurses provide to patients daily.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>is it good for hospital to remove the position of nurses</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, not at all. In my opinion, it makes no sense to <strong>eliminate</strong> the position of nurses. I believe a hospital simply could not <strong>function</strong> well without them for a couple of key reasons.</p>
<p>For one thing, nurses are great helpers for doctors, which allows the entire hospital to run more efficiently. While doctors are busy <strong>diagnosing</strong> complex problems and deciding on major treatments, nurses handle many of the essential, hands-on tasks. For example, they are the ones who give injections, take care of wounds, and constantly monitor a patient’s condition. This frees up doctors to focus on the most critical decisions.</p>
<p>More importantly, nurses provide direct support to patients, both physically and <strong>mentally</strong>. They are often the first ones to step forward when a patient feels pain or is scared. They provide not just medicine, but also comfort and encouragement, which is a vital part of the healing process. This kind of compassionate care is something that machines or other staff members simply can’t replace.</p>

<p><strong>First Point (Supporting Doctors):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>For one thing,</strong> nurses are great helpers for doctors, which allows the hospital to run more efficiently.</li>
<li><strong>One key function of nurses</strong> is to handle many of the essential, hands-on tasks, which frees up doctors’ time.</li>
<li><strong>Looking at hospital workflow,</strong> you can see that nurses are vital for supporting doctors with tasks like giving injections and monitoring patients.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Second Point (Supporting Patients):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>More importantly,</strong> nurses provide direct support to patients, both physically and mentally.</li>
<li><strong>Another crucial aspect</strong> is the emotional comfort and encouragement that nurses offer to patients.</li>
<li><strong>What we can’t forget</strong> is the compassionate care nurses provide, which is a vital part of the healing process.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>So do you think that doctors and nurses are not paid enough?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s an interesting question. In my opinion, the situation is quite different for doctors compared to nurses, so I think it’s a bit of a mixed picture.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, I believe doctors are <strong>relatively</strong> well-paid. Their job requires many years of difficult study and highly specialized skills to <strong>diagnose</strong> complex illnesses and perform treatments. Because of this high level of expertise, their salaries usually reflect the importance and difficulty of their work. So, for the most part, I would say doctors are paid enough.</p>
<p>However, I feel the situation is often different for nurses. While they also work incredibly hard and are essential for patient care, their role is sometimes seen as more service-oriented. As a result, I don’t think their salaries always <strong>compensate</strong> them fairly for their long hours and the huge amount of physical and emotional pressure they are under. So, in many cases, I do believe that nurses are often not paid enough for the crucial work they do.</p>

<p><strong>First Point (About Doctors’ Pay):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Generally speaking,</strong> I believe doctors are relatively well-paid due to their specialized skills.</li>

<p><strong>Second Point (About Nurses’ Pay):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>However,</strong> I feel the situation is often different for nurses, who might be underpaid.</li>
<li><strong>The issue with nurses’ salaries,</strong> I think, is that they don’t always compensate them fairly for their long hours.</li>
<li><strong>In contrast,</strong> a nurse’s role is sometimes seen as more service-oriented, so their pay doesn’t always match the huge pressure they are under.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>So how do today’s people keep healthy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, I think people nowadays use a variety of ways to keep healthy, but two main areas seem to be the most popular: physical exercise and paying close attention to diet.</p>
<p>Firstly, physical activity has become a huge trend. A lot of people, especially the younger generation, choose to go to the gym, <strong>doing</strong> a mix of <strong>aerobic</strong> exercise like running, and <strong>anaerobic</strong> exercise like weight training. For them, this has become a very popular and effective way not only to stay fit but also to release stress from work or study.</p>
<p>Secondly, besides exercise, many people now <strong>put more emphasis on</strong> their diet. They are becoming more conscious about what they eat, often choosing more fresh vegetables and healthy foods over things that are too oily or sugary. I think this is because more people are starting to believe in the old saying, “<strong>you are what you eat</strong>.” They understand that a healthy diet is fundamental to preventing diseases and maintaining good health in the long run.</p>

<li>Well, I think people nowadays use a variety of ways to keep healthy, but two main areas seem to be the most popular.</li>
<li>From what I’ve observed, modern approaches to health generally focus on two key aspects: exercise and diet.</li>
<li>There are many methods, of course, but I believe physical activity and nutrition are the primary ways people try to stay fit today.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>First Point (About Exercise):</strong></p>

<li><strong>Firstly,</strong> physical activity has become a huge trend, especially among the younger generation.</li>
<li><strong>One popular method</strong> is going to the gym for a mix of aerobic and anaerobic exercise.</li>

<li><strong>Secondly,</strong> besides exercise, many people now put more emphasis on their diet.</li>
<li><strong>Another key area</strong> is nutrition, with more people becoming conscious about what they eat.</li>
<li><strong>What’s also very common</strong> is the belief in the saying “you are what you eat,” leading people to choose healthier foods.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it difficult to keep healthy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, I actually think it can be quite difficult for many people to stay healthy in the modern world. It’s not because we don’t know what to do, but because it requires a lot of discipline, especially with exercise and diet.</p>
<p>Firstly, let’s talk about exercise. For most people, it’s not an easy job to <strong>stick to an exercise plan</strong> consistently. We all have busy lives with work or school, and it’s very easy to feel tired at the end of the day and just skip a workout. It requires real self-control and motivation to keep going week after week, which is a big challenge for many.</p>
<p>Secondly, there’s the challenge of healthy eating. Nowadays, we are surrounded by tons of unhealthy food options that are easily available and heavily advertised. The problem is that these junk foods are often <strong>delicious yet harmful</strong>. It takes a lot of willpower to choose a healthy salad over a tasty burger and fries, especially when you’re stressed or short on time. This constant temptation makes eating healthy a real struggle.</p>

<p>[总起句练习]Is it difficult to keep healthy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Main Opening Sentences:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Yes, I actually think it can be quite difficult for many people to stay healthy in the modern world.</li>
<li>In my view, staying healthy consistently is a real challenge, mostly because it requires a lot of discipline.</li>
<li>Although we know what to do, I believe there are a couple of major obstacles that make it hard to stay healthy.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>First Point (Challenge of Exercise):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Firstly,</strong> let’s talk about exercise; it’s not easy for most people to stick to a plan consistently.</li>
<li><strong>One of the biggest challenges</strong> is finding the motivation and energy for regular exercise after a long day of work or school.</li>
<li><strong>For most people,</strong> the difficulty with exercise lies in maintaining self-control week after week.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Second Point (Challenge of Diet):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Secondly,</strong> there’s the challenge of healthy eating, especially with so many unhealthy options available.</li>
<li><strong>Another major hurdle</strong> is the constant temptation of junk food, which is often delicious yet harmful.</li>
<li><strong>What makes it even harder</strong> is that it takes a lot of willpower to choose healthy food when you’re stressed or busy.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>So where can people find informed information about keeping healthy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think people get information about health from a variety of different <strong>sources</strong> nowadays, but I believe the two most common channels are online platforms and their own friends and family.</p>
<p>Firstly, a huge amount of information comes from the internet. Many people rely on social media apps like WeChat or RedNote, where they can easily find and read all sorts of health-related articles. Sometimes, the apps even <strong>recommend</strong> health tips to them based on their interests. It’s a very direct and convenient way to access a lot of information quickly.</p>
<p>Secondly, people also learn <strong>the basics</strong> of staying healthy from their close circle, like their parents and friends. This type of learning is very different; I would say it’s more <strong>gradual and nuanced</strong>. It’s not about reading one specific article, but about observing the healthy habits of people you trust over a long period and picking up their advice day by day. This kind of personal influence can often be more powerful in the long run.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Main Opening Sentences:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I think people get information about health from a variety of different sources nowadays.</li>
<li>When it comes to health information, there are two main channels people typically use: online platforms and their personal circles.</li>
<li>It seems to me that today’s health information is found in both the digital world and through traditional social interactions.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>First Point (Online Sources):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Firstly,</strong> a huge amount of information comes from the internet and social media apps.</li>
<li><strong>The most direct way</strong> people get information is by reading health-related articles and tips online.</li>
<li><strong>One major source</strong> is online platforms, which offer a convenient and quick way to access health content.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Second Point (Friends and Family):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Secondly,</strong> people also learn the basics of staying healthy from their close circle, like parents and friends.</li>
<li><strong>Another important channel</strong> is personal influence, which is often more gradual and nuanced.</li>
<li><strong>Beyond the internet,</strong> people’s habits are often shaped by observing the lifestyles of those they trust over a long period.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you think it is good for for governments to utilize popular celebrities to help build health awareness</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, I think it’s a very good idea. I believe governments should <strong>take advantage of</strong> popular celebrities to help <strong>arouse the public’s health awareness</strong> for a couple of key reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, the biggest advantage is their huge <strong>influence</strong>. Famous celebrities often have millions of <strong>followers</strong> on social media who pay close attention to what they do and say. When a government uses these stars to deliver a message about health, it can reach a massive audience, especially young people, much more effectively than a traditional government advertisement could.</p>
<p>Secondly, these celebrities are often very credible <strong>role models</strong> for a healthy lifestyle. Many of them already <strong>tend to lead</strong> very healthy lives and have a good shape because it’s part of their job. It’s more natural and <strong>persuasive</strong> for people to follow advice from someone who is already a living example of fitness. When a celebrity with great abs tells you to exercise, it can be more convincing than just reading a pamphlet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[总起句练习] Do you think it is good for governments to utilize popular celebrities to help build health awareness?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Main Opening Sentences:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Yes, I think it’s a very good and effective idea for several key reasons.</li>
<li>Absolutely. I believe governments should take advantage of popular celebrities to help arouse the public’s health awareness.</li>
<li>From a strategic point of view, using celebrities for public health campaigns is a very smart move.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>First Point (Their Influence):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Firstly,</strong> the biggest advantage is the huge influence that famous celebrities have.</li>
<li><strong>The main reason this works</strong> is that celebrities can reach a massive audience, especially young people, through social media.</li>
<li><strong>One key factor</strong> is their incredible reach; a message from a star can be more effective than a traditional advertisement.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Second Point (Their Credibility as Role Models):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Secondly,</strong> these celebrities are often very credible role models for a healthy lifestyle.</li>
<li><strong>What also makes this effective</strong> is that many celebrities already lead healthy lives and have a good shape as part of their job.</li>
<li><strong>Another point is their persuasiveness;</strong> it’s more convincing to follow health advice from someone who is a living example of fitness.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>What can parents do to help improve their children’s health awareness?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, I think there are several effective things parents can do to improve their children’s health awareness, mainly in two ways.</p>
<p>First, and perhaps most importantly, they can be a good <strong>role model</strong>. Children are natural observers and tend to copy their parents’ behavior. If kids see their parents consistently exercising, making healthy food choices, and speaking about health positively, they are much more likely to see these actions as normal and adopt these healthy habits themselves.</p>
<p>Secondly, parents can <strong>educate</strong> their children more directly. This doesn’t have to be like a boring lecture. For instance, they can take their kids to the gym or sign them up for sports classes to teach them about physical fitness in a fun way. They can also explain the importance of good nutrition, perhaps by discussing real-life <strong>cases</strong> where poor health choices led to negative <strong>consequences</strong>. This helps children learn the necessary <strong>health concepts</strong> and truly understand why these habits are so important.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Main Opening Sentences:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Well, I think there are several effective things parents can do, mainly in two ways.</li>
<li>I believe parents can play a huge role in improving their children’s health awareness, both indirectly and directly.</li>
<li>From my perspective, the best approaches for parents involve being a good example and providing active education.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>First Point (Being a Role Model):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>First, and perhaps most importantly,</strong> they can be a good role model for their children.</li>
<li><strong>One of the most natural ways</strong> is by leading by example, as children tend to copy their parents’ behavior.</li>
<li><strong>A key strategy</strong> is for parents to consistently make healthy choices themselves, which kids will see as normal.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Second Point (Direct Education):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Secondly,</strong> parents can educate their children more directly about health.</li>
<li><strong>In addition to being a model,</strong> parents should actively involve their kids in healthy activities like sports.</li>
<li><strong>What’s also crucial</strong> is explaining the “why” behind healthy habits, perhaps by discussing the real-life consequences of poor choices.</li>
