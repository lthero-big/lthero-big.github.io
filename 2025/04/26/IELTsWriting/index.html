<p>（不出现具体数字，仅描述两个趋势/一个最大和一个最小），比如法国游客人数最多（2012和2013），美国钱最多（over the same period) , 写概括段只能从表中看到数据，然后自己捏句子，谁最欢迎，谁挣得钱最多；谁增长飞快等</p>
<p>It is noticeable that <strong>France was the world’s most popular tourist country(destination)</strong> in the year 2012 and 2013. By contrast(However), the <strong>USA earned by far the most revenue</strong> from tourism <strong>over the same period.</strong></p>
<h3 id="描述段">描述段</h3>
<p>段一：讲游客数量</p>
<p>先按2012和2013划分，再按从高到低讲游客数量（第一梯队，第二梯队，最后梯队等）</p>
<p>In 2012, there were 83 million tourists visited France, and the USA was <strong>the second most visited destination(country)</strong>, with 66.7 million visitors. Spain and China <strong>received</strong> just under 58 million tourists, whereas <strong>Italy was ranked fifth, at 46.4 million visitors.</strong> 2013 saw a increase of between 1 and 4 million tourists   on each country, with the exception of China, which received a 2 million fewer visitors than <strong>in the previous year.</strong></p>

<li>in the previous year 前一年</li>
</ol>
<p>段二：讲游客花费</p>
<p>先按2012和2013划分，后续和段一差不多</p>
<p>People visited the USA spent more in 2013 than 2012 with 139.6 billion and 126.2 billion respectively.</p>
<p>The figures for spending by visitors in the USA increased from 126.2 billion in 2012 to 139.6 billion in 2013, and which were <strong>well over</strong>(more than) <strong>twice as high as</strong> those for any other country.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you add a multiplier like&quot;twice,&quot; on “as high as”, it specifies that <strong>the first thing is exactly (or more than) double the second thing.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spain received <strong>the second highest amounts of</strong> tourists spending(revenue), rising from 56.3 billion to 60.4 billion, followed by France, China and Italy. Interestingly, despite falling numbers of tourists, the number of revenue in China <strong>rose by 1.7 billion in 2013.</strong></p>

<p>The bar chart compares the proportion of Australian men and women, categorized into six age groups, who participated in periodic physical activity during 2010.</p>
<p>Overall, a clear gender disparity is evident, with female participation rates exceeding those of males across almost all age groups. Furthermore, the two genders display contrasting trends over their lifespan: male activity levels formed a U-shaped curve, whereas female participation peaked in middle age before declining.</p>
<p>Focusing on the males, the highest engagement was recorded among the youngest group (15-24) at 52.8%. <strong>Following this peak</strong>, there was a significant and <strong>steady deterioration</strong> in <strong>activity levels</strong>, which <strong>fell to 42.2%</strong> for the 25-34 age group and subsequently <strong>bottomed out at 39.5% for men aged 35-44</strong>. From this trough, a gradual recovery is observed in the older demographics, with the rate climbing to 46.7% for those aged 65 and over.</p>
<p>In stark contrast, Australian women <strong>consistently showed higher engagement</strong> from the age of 25 onwards. Their participation rate began at 47.7% for the 15-24 bracket and steadily climbed to a zenith of 53.3% in the 45-54 age group. Thereafter, the figure for women <strong>experienced</strong> a <strong>modest</strong> decline. Notably, the gap in activity between the genders narrowed with age, with the figures converging towards parity in the eldest group (47.1% for women versus 46.7% for men).</p>

<p>The line graphs show the mean amount of money that British parents spent on their children’s sporting activities every month and the figure for British children who took part in three different sport activities in a period of six years.</p>
<p>概括</p>
<p>It is clear that British parents spent more money each year on their children’s participation in sports throughout the period shown. In terms of the figure for children taking part, football was by far the most popular activity , significantly more welcomed by children than athletics and swimming.</p>
<p>描述</p>
<p>In 2008, British parents spent an average amount of around 20 pounds every month on their children’s sports. Over the following six years, parents’ spending on children’s sporting activities increased steadly, and by 2014 the average monthly amount had risen to just over 30 pounds.</p>

Parents’ expenditure on children’s sport increased steadly over the following six years, and by 2014 the figure for average monthly amount of spending had risen to just over 30 pounds.</p>
<p>描述</p>
<p>Looking at the participation numbers, in 2008, children enrolled in football account for nearly 8 million, which is nearly four times as high as the figure for those taking part in swimming, and less than 1 million participated athietics. The figure for football participation remained relatively stable over the following six years. By contrast, participation in swimming almost doubled, to nearly 4 million children in the year 2014, and there was a dramatic increase in the number of children doing athietics.</p>
<p>Looking at the participation numbers, in 2008 approximately 8 million British children were enrolled in football, while only 2 million children taking part in swimming course and less than one million participated athletics. The figure for football participation remained relatively stable around 8 to 9 million over the following years. By contrast, participation in swimming almost doubled, to nearly 4 million children in 2014, and there was a nearly fivefold increase in the figure for children doing athletics.</p>

<p>The bar chart compares the analysis of a survey conducted among residents of five Australian cities in terms of their coffee and tea comsumption hobbies.</p>
<p>It is clear that the vast majority of residents visited cafes for coffee or tea in last four weeks across all cities. By contrast, there was no significant difference in the percentage of those who chose to buy instant coffee over the same period.</p>
<p>Looking first at the metropolitan areas, people living in Melbourne prefer going to cafe for coffee or tea, standing at nearly 64% of the total. In comparison, only 42% of Melburnians prefer buying fresh coffee, while Sydney residents have a slightly higher preference at 44%.</p>
<p>With regard to other cities, it is noticable that Hobart has the second-highest percentage of residents who enjoy going to stores for coffee or tea, at approximately 63%. There is no t a clear difference between the figures for people living in Adelaide who prefer buying instant coffee versus those who prefer going out for a drink, both of which are around 50%. Finally, only less than 35% of residents in Brisbane and Adelaide purchased fresh coffee during last four weeks.</p>

<p>This line chart illustrates the figures for visitors to a Caribbean island over a period of eight years.</p>
<p>It is evident that there was a clear preference for people visiting the Caribbean island between 2010 and 2017, while the figure for people choosing to stay on the island remained relatively stable.</p>
<p>In 2010, approximately one million tourists visited the island, with merely 0.25 million of them opting to stay on cruise ships. Over the following six years, the figure for those visiting on cruise ships increased considerably, reaching nearly 1.5 million in 2016. By contrast, there was no significant difference in the number of travelers staying on the island during the same period, which stayed around 1.2 million to 1.5 million per year.</p>
<p>Between 2016 and 2017, the total number of visitors increased dramatically, more than threefold, reaching 3.5 million. During this time, visitors staying on cruise ships made a greater contribution than tourists staying on the island, with 2 million and 1.5 million respectively.</p>
<p>9分</p>
<p>The line graph presented delineates the influx of tourists to a Caribbean island from 2010 to 2017, disaggregated by the type of accommodation chosen.</p>
<p>Overall, there is a notable upward trajectory in the number of visitors across all categories, with those opting to stay on the island consistently outnumbering cruise ship visitors throughout the period under review.</p>
<p>In 2010, the total number of tourists reached approximately 1 million, comprised of around 0.25 million visitors on cruise ships and around 0.75 million choosing to stay on the island. <strong>The trend over the subsequent years reveals a significant increase in tourist numbers</strong>, with visitors staying on cruise ships experiencing a robust rise. By 2017, numbers for cruise ship visitors had surged to about 1.25 million, while those staying on the island escalated to approximately 2.75 million, reflecting substantial growth in both categories.</p>
<p>The overall total of visitors to the Caribbean island reached 4 million by 2017, marking a marked increase from previous years. Specifically, the number of tourists on cruise ships and those staying on the island demonstrated a coordinated growth trend. The figure for visitors residing on the island consistently constituted the majority, revealing a sustained preference among tourists for land-based accommodation over the cruise option. This trend underscores the island’s appeal as a desirable destination for extended stays.</p>

<p>The diagram below shows the manufacturing process for making sugar from sugar cane. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The picture illustrates the process of producing sugar from sugar cane. Generally speaking, there are seven main stages in the process, starting with growing sugar canes on farms and ending with drying and cooling sugar.</p>
<p>The first four steps involve the collection and purification of the sugar canes. The process commences with cane being grown over a period of a year before being harvested through mechanical machines and manual methods, which then leads to a crushing process. In this stage, sugar canes are crushed in a grinder, resulting in the formation of juice. Following this, the sugar cane juice is purified through a limestone filter in order to obtain clean syrup. The remaining steps incorporate the evaporation of juice under heat to produce syrup. Subsequently, sugar crystals are separated from the syrup under a centrifuge machine. In the final step, the resulting sugar crystals are dried and cooled to create final sugar.</p>

<p>The plans illustrate the current layout of Southwest airport and the proposed redevelopment in the years to come. Generally speaking, the airport will undergo significant expansion, introducing new facilities and doubling the number of gates to enhance convenience of passengers and capacity of planes.</p>
<p>The location of the departures and arrivals will remain the same as they are no, while additional doors will be installed. The check-in counter is expected to relocated from the left side to the right side of the departures hall during the redevelopment, while the cafe and a new bag drop facility will be added at the left spot. Furthermore, the new sky train will replace the walkway leading to more convenience for passengers, and a branching corridor will be constructed to add ten more gates for passengers.</p>
<p>the security passport control and passport control customs will remain the same as they are now, while three more facilities will be added to the arrivals which are the cafe, ATM and car hire service. Additionally, shops are expected to be constructed in the place which can be seen immediately after passing the security passport control.</p>

<p><strong>It is often said that modern life presents us with an overwhelming number of choices, I completely agree with that, and I believe that the Internet and globalisation are the two major factors involved.</strong></p>
<p>On the one hand, It is undeniable that the Interned has led to a dramatic expansion in the number of choices that are available to us. The number of online media options, for instance, is now almost endless. There are countless websites offering entertainment, news, videos, music and live streaming, many of which are free. I would argue that this abundance of media leads to confusion on average users, as we have to make so many decisions about the content that we consume. A prime example of this trend would be the fact that people had only a few choices of TV channels when they were young, whereas they now have access to thousands of films and series through services like Netflix.</p>
<p>On the other hand, alongside the influence of the Internet, globalisation is making the world smaller and compounding this problem of too much choice. Cheat international flights have made overseas travel possible for millions of people, but this also means that we are faced with a world of options when deciding where to go on holiday and even where to live.

<p>On the one hand, it is undeniable that the Interned has led to a dramatic expansion in number of choices that are available to us. The number of online meadia options, for example, is now almost endless. There are countless weebsites offering entertainment, news, videos, music and live streaming, many of which are free. I would agree that this amount of media leads to confusion on the part of people, as we have to make so many decisions on the content that we consume. A prime example of this trend would be the fact that people had only a few choice of TV channels when they were young, whhile they now have access to thousands of films and TV series throught services such as Netflix.</p>
<p>On the other hand, alongside the influence of the Internet, globalisation is making the world smaller and compunding the problem of too much choice. Cheap international flights made overseas travel possible for millions of average people, but this also means that we are faced a with a world of options when we decide where to go on holiday and even where to live. We no longer have the limited but simple travel option of our grandparents’ generation. The same is true if we look at the increasing tendency for young people to study abroad. While the opportunity for overseas study seems appealing, many students are confused about where to go and which path to choice.</p>
<p>On the other hand, alongside the influence of the Internet, career options is making the world more complex and compunding the problem of too much choice. Emergency of AI opened up a new employment field for many workers, but this also means that we are faced with a huge number of specific and new fields when deciding which path to take. We no longer have the limited but simple career options of our grandparents’ generation. The same is true if we look at the increasing tendency for</p>
<p>On the one hand, it is undeniable that the Internet has led to a dramatic expansion in the number of choices that are available for us. The number of online media options, for instance, is now almost countless. There are endless websites offering entertainment, news, videos, music and live streaming, most of which are free. I would argue that this abundance of media leads to confusion on the part of average people, as we have to make so many decisions about the content we consume. A prime example of this trend would be the fact that people had only a few TV channels when they were young, while they have access to thousands of films and TV series throught streaming platforms like Netflix.</p>
<p><strong>In the advertising, businesses nowadays usually emphasise that their products are new in some way. Why is this? Do you think it is a positive or negative development?</strong></p>
<p>In contemporary era, an increasing number of firms and manufacturers tend to highlight new features when marketing their new products and services. The essence of this phenomenon is that the younger generation of consumers is often attracted to novel and innovative features of products. I firmly believe that this advertising development can bring many positive aspects to community.</p>
<p>One reason manufacturers emphasize new features of these products is to attract more customers, especially during economic downturns in many different companies. Today’s consumers are looking for products that offer good value, so products and items with more new updated features would attract more interest from people. For instance, many car manufacturers put more emphasis on inner designs and advanced software services like autonomous driving technology; customers are more likely to choose cars with additional useful functions rather than those designed solely for commuting.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the rapid development of technology provides manufacturers and companies with an improved environment to innovate and create products rich in new features. These features would significantly appeal to individuals who may not be the primary target customers. For example, there are smartphones designed specially for children that restrict distracting applications. However, phones incorporating AI functions like ChatGPT are more likely to be popular among children, as these new features not only capture their interest but also assist them with their assignments.</p>
<p>In conclusion, firms’ emphasis on product features can be seen as positive only when the features are genuinely new and useful. However, if they are not, companies will set a high bar and might lose consumer trust.</p>
